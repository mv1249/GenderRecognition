# GenderRecognition
This is Deep Learning Project which recognizes the Gender of the Person,when visible in front of camera
i've used the VGG16 architecture,i.e transfer learning approach as backend and OpenCv library for making predictions as Front-end
in genral the dataset contained 10k images,i could'nt upload it as per the guidelines of git...so i've done image selection and reduced the number of images and created a new dataset 
which i've uploaded.
